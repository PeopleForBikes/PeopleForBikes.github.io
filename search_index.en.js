Use the @ mention in the comments.\nUnless explicitly asked, pull request which don't pass all the CI checks\nwill not be reviewed. Use the @ mention in the comments to ask maintainers\nto help you.\n\nCommit example\n\nThe following commit is a good example as:\n\nThe fist line is a short description and starts with an imperative verb.\nThe first paragraph describes why this commit may be useful.\nThe last line points to an existing issue and will automatically close it.\n\n","id":"https://peopleforbikes.github.io/contributing/","title":"Contributing"},"https://peopleforbikes.github.io/guidelines/":{"body":"Tooling and library guidelines\nGoals\nConsistency\nWe want to ensure consistency in the tools and libraries used for the\nPeopleForBikes projects.\nIdeally a contributor working on one project should be familiar enough with the\ntools and libraries to be able to fix bugs or implement features in another one.\nRemoving choice fatigue\nWe aim at preventing choice fatigue by working with tools and libraries that we\nalready battle tested.\nFor instance a contributor looking to implement some logging in a new project\nshould not spend a day or two researching and evaluating libraries, but should\ninstead refer to this guide to pick the one we recommend.\nLimiting dependency proliferation\nLimiting the amount of third-party software you rely on reduces the surface of\nattacks you may be vulnerable to.\nHere as an example, are just a couple of impactful events that happen within\nrecent years:\n\nMalicious code found in npm package event-stream\nOpen Source Developer Intentionally Corrupts NPM Libraries\nGitHub Confirms Another Major NPM Security Defect\n\nLanguages\nLike dependencies, we try to reduce the amount of general-purpose programming\nlanguages we use for PeopleForBikes projects, therefore we decided to only\nadopt TypeScript, Rust and Python.\nThey are respectively used for the following use cases:\n\nWeb projects must be written in TypeScript.\nProjects dealing with data science or GIS must be written in Python.\nAll other projects must be written in Rust.\n\nGeneral Concepts\nThese are general concepts that we attempt to abide to in the PeopleForBikes\nprojects.\n\nRecommended libraries are not set in stone\n\nPossible to add libraries if they meet pre-defined criteria\n\nActive project\n\nResponse to issues, PR within a reasonable timeframe (1-2 weeks)\nAt least one commit within the past 6 months\n\n\nNo known vulnerabilities\nWell enough documented\n\ni.e. no tribal knowledge required to use them\n\n\nSolve a problem\n\n\nReplacing/Removing a library is possible too\n\nPropose a new valid alternative\nPropose a replacement and/or deprecation strategy\n\ne.g. not all projects need to migrate, only new and very active ones\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse linters with default configurations\n\nUnless there is an absolute need for a change\n\n\n\nREST APIs\n\nWe try to follow the GitHub REST API documentation and the jsonapi.org\nspecification for error management.\nZalando provides very good\nRESTful API Guidelines\nworth following\n\nPython\nProject management\n\nuv: The future of Python project management\n\nWe recommend using just for managing administration tasks,

standards represent the way of working of the BNA Mechanics team.\nThey aim to create an enjoyable contributing culture, while making it obvious\nand natural to build high quality deliverables.\nBehavioral standards\nCulture &amp; Values\n\nPass negatives up, positives all around.\nOperate with a self-employed mentality - have agency.\nStrive for quality even in the little things.\nDon't cling on a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.\n\nCollaboration\n\nWe succeed or fail together.\nWe should feel empowered to pair with anyone to work across the stack.\nBefore writing any code, we should agree on the design &amp; direction of the\nupcoming feature.\nInclude our users/consumers when determining our features &amp; requirements.\nFavor cooperative exploration over debate when you can - you can’t learn and\ndefend at the same time.\n\nOperational standards\nData-driven\n\nUse data wherever available to make the right choices and inform decisions.\nIf we care about something, we should ensure we have a way to measure it.\n\nAutomation\n\nStrive to automate everything which is automatable.\n\nDocumentation\n\nWrite the appropriate documentation for the work we are doing.\n\nREADME.md, Changelog.md, API docs, General documentation, etc.\n\n\nWhen breaking down work, we should provide a roadmap for what/how we plan to\niterate to a complete feature.\nWhen creating external documentation for a consumer of our software, we should\nsolicit feedback from them &amp; update accordingly.\nAvoid tribal knowledge.\n\nError Handling as a First-Class Citizen\n\nWe should plan for and handle errors early, rather than only coding the \"happy\npath\".\nWe should continually ask \"how can this fail?\"\nIf we don't know the right way to handle the error, we should at least have a\nplace in the code where we can come back to in order to handle it properly.\nMaintain a backlog of known issues, and review &amp; prioritize them alongside new\nfeatures.\n\nProject Standards\nGeneral recommendations\n\nProjects must provide a way to build artifacts using standard tools (i.e. no\ncustom scripts made for a specific machine/environment)\n\na package or binary depending on the language\na docker image\n\n\nProjects must include a Changelog following the\nKeep a Changelog recommendation\nProject must adhere to Semantic Versioning\n\nOr Calendar Versioning if it makes more sense.\n\n\nProjects must use Issues and Pull Request templates\nProjects must use meaningful labels\nProjects must be documented\nProjects must automate all their maintenance tasks\n\nMust ensure reproducibility\nA Makefile, justfile or a package.json at the root of the project is a good\nexample of how to automate maintenance tasks.\nNon trivial commands must be backed by scripts (instead of being written\ninline).\n\n\nImplement REST APIs from business requirements, and document them using the\nOpenAPI 3+ specification (i.e. code first\napproach)\n\nGenerate the OpenAPI 3+ specification from the server\nGenerate the clients from the OpenAPI 3+ specification for any language\nneeded.\n\nClients must be 100% generated, although they might be extended if\nneeded.\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Integration\nThe CI rules:\n\nProjects must comply with CI task requirements.\nDevelopers must be able to run the tasks locally.\nThe CI acts as the source of truth.\nThe master branch must be continually deployable.\n\nThe PeopleForBikes/.github repository contains starter workflows that should\nbe used when creating a project.\nRequired tasks\n\nFormatter\nLinters\n\nCode\nDocs\n\n\nStatic analyzers\nDocumentation\nUnit tests\nFeature tests\n\nTry to cover 100% of use cases\n\nThis is more important than

code.\nEliminate failing &amp; flaky tests.\nTests should be run on every PR, automatically.\nWe should aim to write unit, integration and end-to-end tests (where it makes\nsense).\nIf a PR does not have tests, we should feel empowered to question why.\nWhen a bug is found , we should aim to add a test that exercises the bug, so\nit does not happen again.\nUse doctest to test the happy path.\n\nThis will also enhance the quality of the documentation by providing short\nexamples to the users.\n\n\n\nLicenses\nThe BNA Mechanics team selected the following licenses to use depending on the\ntype of work being done:\n\nMIT license to be used for code\nCC-BY license to be used for content other than code\n(documentation, media)\nCC0 license to be used for snippets, data,\nboilerplate\nFor something else or special circumstances, open an issue in the specific\nproject or contact the team.\n\nSoftware\nDefault: MIT\nFor most substantial BNA Mechanics open source software projects, there's a\nsimple default answer: MIT.\nMIT is the\nmost popular license\nfor public open source projects on github. It has great cultural acceptance\nand is simple to understand, use, and comply with:\n\nAdd a LICENSE.md file at the root of the project, with the MIT license\ntext and PeopleForBikes copyright notice: \"Copyright (c) 2022 PeopleForBikes\".\nWhen using the GitHub CLI to create a new\nproject, the file will be automatically added. Otherwise, simply copy the\nlicense text from https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit\nKeep that LICENSE.md file and copyright notice in any modified versions.\n\nIf you feel that MIT is really the wrong license for a substantial BNA\nMechanics open source project, let's talk with the team.\nContent\nDefault: CC-BY-4.0\nOccasionally we publish substantial non-software content (e.g., documentation,\nmedia) that we want to give others permission to copy, modify, and distribute if\nthey give us credit and don't use our trademarks. That's what CC-BY-4.0\nallows. It's roughly equivalent to MIT in terms of being permissive and having\ngood cultural acceptance, but is designed for non-software works (e.g., license\nnotice can be provided with a link rather than including a copy of the license\ntext).\nTo use CC-BY-4.0:\n\nIn the case an entire repository should be released under CC-BY-4.0: add a\nLICENSE.md file with the CC-BY-4.0 license text. It is unlikely you will\nwant to do this, and it is not facilitated by the web interface license\npicker. The license text is available at\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt but check with the\nteam to ensure this is what you really want.\nIn the case particular files or parts of content (e.g., documentation or a\nmedia file) should be released under CC-BY-4.0, note this precisely in the\nrepository's README.md.\nIf the released material is rendered or published, e.g., as or in web pages,\nit can also be useful to include a CC-BY-4.0 notice there, e.g., \"This\ndocumentation is released under CC-BY-4.0\", with a link to\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ or the repository\nREADME.md#Licenses depending on the complexity of the situation. Please ask\nthe team for help getting it right.\nTo use material under CC-BY-4.0, license notice and attribution must be\npreserved. It can be useful to provide an example of how to do so.\n\nIf you feel that CC-BY-4.0 is really the wrong license for substantial GitHub\nopen source non-software content, let's talk with the team.\nNon-substantial works\nDefault: CC0-1.0\nMIT and CC-BY-4.0 conditions are easy to comply with, but sometimes projects\nare better served by not having any conditions, not even a requirement for\nattribution.\nCC0-1.0 waives all copyright restrictions but reserves trademark and patent\nrights, making it an easy unconditional license for PeopleForBikes material\nwhen:\n\nburden to user of maintaining copyright notices forever is large relative to\nincremental value of using licensed material, and\nthere is no demonstrable business value from mandating maintenance of\ncopyright notices\n\nExamples\n\nSample snippets; eg those under https://developer.github.com/guides/\nStarter or other boilerplate material\nPurely functional configuration with minimal expressivity that we don't think\nis/ought be subject to copyright anyway; add certainty that there are no\nrestrictions\nData in which there is clearly no demonstrable business value from mandating\nmaintenance of copyright notices\nMore substantial code/material alongside/in same repo as one of the above and\nstill no demonstrable business value from restrictions; just use an\nunconditional license for more substantial bits to minimize number of\nlicenses involved\n\nTo use CC0-1.0:\n\nIn the case an entire repository should be released under CC0-1.0: add a\nLICENSE.md file with the CC0-1.0 license text. You can do this via the web\ninterface on github (a license picker will automatically appear when you add\na new file called LICENSE.md) or by copying the license text from\nhttps://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0-1.0\nIn the case particular files or parts of content (e.g., code snippets in\ndocumentation) should be released under CC0-1.0, note this precisely in the\nrepository's README.md.\nIf the released material is rendered or published, e.g., as or in web pages,\nit can also be useful to include a CC0-1.0 notice there, e.g., \"Code samples\nin this documentation are released under CC0-1.0\", with a link to\nhttps://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ or the repository\nREADME.md#Licenses depending on the complexity of the situation. Please ask\nthe team for help getting it right.\nNote there are zero copyright license requirements when using material\nreleased under CC0-1.0, but it is usually best practice to maintain license\nnotices and attribution anyway, as you would for MIT and [CC-BY] software\nand non-software above.\n\nHave questions about whether what you're working on matches one of the above\nexample classes and meets the two criteria above, or feel that CC0-1.0 isn't\nthe right license for those cases? Let's talk with the team.\nNaming conventions\nVersioning\n\n\nAssets should alway be versioned, following the calver specification with\nthe [v]YY.0M[.Minor] scheme, where:\n\nThe letter \"v\" (for \"version\") precedes the scheme (optional).\nYY represents the year with 2 digits (e.g.: 22 for 2022)\n0M represents the zero-padded month of the year (e.g.: 01, 02, 11, 12)\nMinor represents the iteration number starting at one (1), without\nzero-padding (e.g: 1, 2, 10, etc.). It must be omitted when it is equal to\nzero (0).\n\nFor instance, it is common to go through several iterations for a template,\nor several revisions of a document throughout the year:\n\ntemplate-scorecard-v22.05.4.svg\ncity_ratings_v22.11.csv\nchicago_illinois-scorecard-v24.05.pdf\nchicago_illinois-scorecard-v24.05.3.pdf\n\n\n\nVisual assets\nVisual assets should be named in a way where contributors can easily extract the\nrelevant information directly from the file name itself. There must not be any\ncomplicated nested folder structure necessary.\n\n\nThe global naming convention must respect the following pattern:\n&lt;type&gt;-&lt;name&gt;-&lt;description&gt;[-&lt;size&gt;][-&lt;orientation&gt;].&lt;extension&gt;\n\n\n&lt;type&gt; must be one of the following:\n\nbg (short for background)\nicon\nlogo\ntemplate\n\n\n\nLower case only\n\n\nDo not use spaces, use dashes\n\n\n&lt;size&gt; can be simplified if the asset is a square. E.g. “512” would mean\n“512x512”\n\nImages with the .svg &lt;extension&gt; do not have a size since they can be\nresized at will\n\n\n\n&lt;orientation&gt; (or shape) can optionally be added if it provides value\nValid values are:\n\nsquare\nstacked\nhorizontal\nvertical\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nlogo-bna-full-1015x596.png\nlogo-bna-full-dark-white-text-1015×597.png\nlogo-pfb-no-text-square.svg\n\nAdministrative tasks\nWe recommend using the GitHub CLI in general as we\nfind it very convenient, but even if it is not your cup of tea, it should at\nleast be used to create new repositories with the right parameters from the get\ngo.\nAll the operations can also be performed via the GitHub website.\n\nRemark: these operations require administrator privileges.\n\nCreate a new GitHub repository\nStart by defining the PFB variables:\n\nThen, depending of the type of project being created, the bootstrap process\nvaries.\nBootstrap a NextJS project\nCreate the NextJS app:\n\nImport the BNA mechanics files:\n\nCheck the .github/workflows folder and remove the workflows that do not belong\nto the project.\n\nConfigure the GitHub CLI to use SSH:\n\nCreate the GitHub repository:\n\nBootstrap a Rust/Python project\nCreate the GitHub repository:\n\nInitialize the project, depending on the programming language:\n\nRust: cargo init\nPython:\nuv init --name \"${PFB_REPO}\" --description \"${PFB_REPO_DESCRIPTION}\"\n\nAdd a README.md and the appropriate .gitignore file:\n\nThen submit the changes:\n\nAll projects\nCheck the .github/workflows folder and remove the workflows that do not belong\nto the project.\nApply the labels with labelr:\n\nFinally, setup the branch protection:\n\nThe checks may need to be adjusted based on the language that was selected\nfor the project.\n\n\n\nAs the final touch, some repository settings can also be adjusted:\n\nArchive a public repository\nArchive repositories to indicate that they are unmaintained and make them\nread-only.\nStart by editing the repository's README.md file to add the following note at\nthe top:\n\nClose all open issues and pull requests and archive the repository:\n\n","id":"https://peopleforbikes.github.io/standards/","title":"Standards"}},"docInfo":{"https://peopleforbikes.github.io/":{"body":104,"title":2},"https://peopleforbikes.github.io/code-of-conduct/":{"body":429,"title":2},"https://peopleforbikes.github.io/contributing/":{"body":174,"title":1},"https://peopleforbikes.github.io/guidelines/":{"body":567,"title":1},"https://peopleforbikes.github.io/standards/":{"body":1283,"title":1}},"length":5},"lang":"English"}
