# Overview

**[PeopleForBikes](https://www.peopleforbikes.org/)** is an industry coalition
made up of 280 cycling-industry members and a cycling community of almost 1.4
million individual riders to promote stronger representation in congress and
coordinated advocacy programs and help develop and promote economic policies
that benefit bike businesses.

**PeopleForBikes Tech** is PFB's technical arm. We aim to simplify and automate
tasks to help our advocates focus on what they do best: get more people riding
bikes more often, and make bike riding better for everyone.

Our projects:

- [retrieve](https://github.com/PeopleForBikes/retrieve): Simplify downloading
  PeopleForBikes dataset
- [svggloo](https://github.com/PeopleForBikes/svggloo): Render SVG templates
- [measure](https://github.com/PeopleForBikes/measure): Quantify and identify
