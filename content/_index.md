# Overview

**[PeopleForBikes]** is a national bike advocacy organization and trade group
for the bike industry working to make bicycling safe, convenient, and fun for
people of all ages and abilities. The [Bicycle Network Analysis], a.k.a. the
BNA, is open source software that assesses the quality and connectivity of bike
networks in cities. The [BNA] is an integral part of PeopleForBikesâ€™ [City
Ratings] program, which measures progress towards building great cities for bikes,
shares best practices, and engages more people in bike advocacy.

**BNA Mechanics** is the technical group developing the [BNA]. We aim to
simplify and automate tasks to help our advocates focus on what they do best:
get more people riding bikes more often, and make bike riding better for
everyone.

Our projects:

- [brokenspoke]: A collection of tools for the BNA
- [brokenspoke-analyzer]: Run Bicycle Network Analysis locally
- [measure]: Quantify and identify bike lanes in cities
- [scorecards]: Retrieve the BNA scorecards for your country

And more to come!
