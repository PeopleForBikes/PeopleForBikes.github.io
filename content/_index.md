# Overview

**[PeopleForBikes]** is a national bike advocacy organization and trade group
for the bike industry working to make bicycling safe, convenient, and fun for
people of all ages and abilities. The [Bicycle Network Analysis] ([BNA]) is open
source software that assesses the quality and connectivity of bike networks in
cities. The [BNA] is an integral part of PeopleForBikesâ€™ [City Ratings] program,
which measures progress towards building great cities for bikes, shares best
practices, and engages more people in bike advocacy.

**BNA Mechanics** is the technical group developing the [BNA]. We aim to simplify
and automate tasks to help our advocates focus on what they do best: get more
people riding bikes more often, and make bike riding better for everyone.

Our projects:
