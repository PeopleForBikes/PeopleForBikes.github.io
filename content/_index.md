# Overview

**PeopleForBikes** is an organization promoting cycling in the US.

**PeopleForBikes Tech** is the technical branch of it. We aim at simplifying and
automating tasks to help our advocates focus on what they do best: get more
people riding bikes more often, and make bike riding better for everyone.

Our projects:

* retrieve: Simplify downloading PeopleForBikes dataset
* svggloo: Render SVG templates
* measure: Quantify and identify bike lanes in cities
