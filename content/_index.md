# Overview

**[PeopleForBikes](https://www.peopleforbikes.org/)** is an industry coalition made up of 280 cycling-industry members and a cycling community of almost 1.4 million individual riders to promote stronger representation in congress and coordinated advocacy programs and  help develop and promote economic policies that benefit bike businesses.

**[PeopleForBikes Tech](http://example.com/)** is PFB's technical arm. We aim to simplify and
automate tasks to help our advocates focus on what they do best: get more
people riding bikes more often, and make bike riding better for everyone.

Our projects:

* [retrieve](http://example.com/): Simplify downloading PeopleForBikes dataset
* [svggloo](http://example.com/): Render SVG templates
* [measure](http://example.com/): Quantify and identify bike lanes in cities
