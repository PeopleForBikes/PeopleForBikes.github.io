# Tooling and library guidelines

## Goals

### Consistency

We want to ensure consistency in the tools and libraries used for the
[PeopleForBikes] projects.

Ideally a contributor working on one project should be familiar enough with the
tools and libraries to be able to fix bugs or implement features in another one.

### Removing choice fatigue

We aim at preventing choice fatigue by working with tools and libraries that we
already battle tested.

For instance a contributor looking to implement some logging in a new project
should not spend a day or two researching and evaluating libraries, but should
instead refer to this guide to pick the one we recommend.

### Limiting dependency proliferation

Limiting the amount of third-party software you rely on reduces the surface of
attacks you may be vulnerable to.

Here as an example, are just a couple of impactful events that happen within
recent years:

- [Malicious code found in npm package event-stream](https://snyk.io/blog/malicious-code-found-in-npm-package-event-stream/)
- [Open Source Developer Intentionally Corrupts NPM Libraries](https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/open-source-developer-intentionally-corrupts-npm-libraries-suspected-hack-turns-out-to-be-mischief/)
- [GitHub Confirms Another Major NPM Security Defect](https://www.securityweek.com/github-confirms-another-major-npm-security-defect)

## Languages

Like dependencies, we try to reduce the amount of general-purpose programming
languages we use for [PeopleForBikes] projects, therefore we decided to only
adopt Javascript, [Rust] and [Python].

They are respectively used for the following use cases:

- Web projects must be written in Javascript
- Projects dealing with data science or GIS must be written in [Python].
- All other projects must be written in [Rust].

## General Concepts

These are general concepts that we attempt to abide to in the [PeopleForBikes]
projects.

- Recommended libraries are not set in stone
  - Possible to add libraries if they meet pre-defined criteria
    - Active project
      - Response to issues, PR within a reasonable timeframe (1-2 weeks)
      - At least one commit within the past 6 months
    - No known vulnerabilities
    - Well enough documented
      - i.e. no tribal knowledge required to use them
    - Solve a problem
  - Replacing/Removing a library is possible too
    - Propose a new valid alternative
    - Propose a replacement and/or deprecation strategy
      - e.g. not all projects need to migrate, only new and very active ones
- Use linters with default configurations
  - Unless there is an absolute need for a change

## Python

### Project management

- [poetry]: Python project management de facto standard

We recommend using [just] for managing administration tasks, but for more
complex scenarios [invoke] is an acceptable replacement.

### Poetry settings

Each project must create a local virtual environment at its root :

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true --local
```

### pyproject.toml

Describes special sections to add to the `pyproject.toml` configuration file.

#### coverage

Leaves some files out the measurements.

```toml
[tool.coverage.run]
omit = ["*/__init__.py"]
```

#### isort

Enables the compatibility with `black` while shaping the import as a grid where
each import has its own line.

```toml
[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
force_grid_wrap = 2
```

#### pytest

Removes the warnings, configures the code coverage report and run the doctests
with [xdoctest].

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
minversion = "6.0"
addopts = "-p no:warnings --cov-report term-missing --cov-report html --xdoctest"
```

### Initialization

To quickly start a project, run the following commands:

```bash
export POETRY_PROJECT=my-project
poetry new ${POETRY_PROJECT}
cd ${POETRY_PROJECT}
poetry add -G dev \
  black \
  bpython \
  furo\
  isort \
  myst-parser \
  pytest \
  pytest-cov \
  pytest-mock \
  pytest-rerunfailures \
  pytest-socket \
  pytest-xdist \
  ruff \
  Sphinx\
  sphinx-autobuild \
  sphinx-copybutton \
  xdoctest
```

### Libraries

## SQL

## Tooling

- [just]: General purpose task runner

## Web

Web project must be built with [React], [Next.js] and [Tailwind CSS].

### Tailwind CSS

#### tailwind.config.js

We extend the existing [Tailwind CSS] theme with the PFB fonts and colors:

```js
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    fontFamily: {
      sans: ["Montserrat", "sans-serif"],
      dharma": ["Dharma Gothic E"],
    },
    extend: {
      colors: {
        "pfb-deep-navy": "#00263E",
        "pfb-bright-cyan": "#009EDB",
        "pfb-bright-red": "#D71920",
        "pfb-coal": "#4D4D4F",
        "pfb-gray": "#8B8A8D",
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

#### Custom fonts

PFB uses some custom private fonts that require some setup in order to be used.

First, copy the font files into the `public/fonts` folder of the web project.
The font are available in the
[Brokenspoke repository](https://github.com/PeopleForBikes/brokenspoke/tree/main/assets/fonts/DharmaGothicExtended).

The folders should look like this:

```bash
public
├── fonts
│   ├── Dharma Type - DharmaGothicE-Bold.otf
│   └── Dharma Type - DharmaGothicE-Light.otf
```

Add the new `font-faces` to `styles/globals.css`:

```css
// styles/globals.css

@font-face {
  font-family: "Dharma Gothic E";
  src: url("../public/fonts/Dharma Type - DharmaGothicE-ExBold.otf") format("opentype");
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "Dharma Gothic E";
  src: url("../public/fonts/Dharma Type - DharmaGothicE-ExLight.otf") format("opentype");
}
```

A new custom font family is now available using the [Tailwind CSS] class
`font-dharma`.
