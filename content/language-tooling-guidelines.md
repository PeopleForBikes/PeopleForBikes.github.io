# Tooling and library guidelines

## Goals

### Consistency

We want to ensure consistency in the tools and libraries used for the
[PeopleForBikes] projects.

Ideally a contributor working on one project should be familiar enough with the
tools and libraries to be able to fix bugs or implement features in another one.

### Removing choice fatigue

We aim at preventing choice fatigue by working with tools and libraries that we
already battle tested.

For instance a contributor looking to implement some logging in a new project
should not spend a day or two researching and evaluating libraries, but should
instead refer to this guide to pick the one we reccomend.

### Limiting dependency proliferation

Limiting the amount of third-party software you rely on reduces the surface of
attacks you may be vulnerable to.

Here as an example, are just a couple of impactful events that happen within
recent years:

* [Malicious code found in npm package event-stream](https://snyk.io/blog/malicious-code-found-in-npm-package-event-stream/)
* [Open Source Developer Intentionally Corrupts NPM Libraries](https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/open-source-developer-intentionally-corrupts-npm-libraries-suspected-hack-turns-out-to-be-mischief/)
* [GitHub Confirms Another Major NPM Security Defect](https://www.securityweek.com/github-confirms-another-major-npm-security-defect)

## Languages

Like dependencies, we try to reduce the amount of general-purpose programming
languages we use for [PeopleForBikes] projects, therefore we decided to only
adopt [Rust] and [Python].

They are respectively used for the following use cases:

* Projects dealing with data science must be written in Python.
* All other projects must be written in Rust.

## General Concepts

These are general concepts that we attempt to abid to in the [PeopleForBikes]
projects.

* Recomended libraries are not set in stone
  * Possible to add librairies if they meet pre-defined criterias
    * Active project
      * Response to issues, PR within a reasonable timeframe (1-2 weeks)
      * At least one commit within the past 6 months
    * No known vulnerabilities
    * Well enough documented
      * i.e. no tribal knowledge required to use them
    * Solve a problem
  * Replacing/Removing a library is possible too
    * Propose a new valid alternative
    * Propose a replacement and/or deprecation strategy
      * e.g. not all projects need to migrate, only new and very active ones
* Use linters with default configurations
  * Unless there is an absolute need for a change

## Python

### Project management

* [poetry]: Python project management de facto standard
* [invoke]: Pure python task runner

### Poetry settings

Each project must create a local virtual environment at its root :

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true --local
```

### pyproject.toml

Describes special sections to add to the `pyproject.toml` configuration file.

```toml
[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
force_single_line = "true"
```

### Initialization

To quickly start a project, run the following commands:

```bash
POETRY_PROJECT=my-project
poetry new ${POETRY_PROJECT}
cd ${POETRY_PROJECT}
poetry add -D \
  black \
  bpython \
  flake8 \
  furo\
  invoke \
  isort \
  myst-parser \
  pydocstyle \
  pylint \
  pytest \
  pytest-cov \
  pytest-mock \
  pytest-rerunfailures \
  pytest-socket \
  pytest-xdist \
  Sphinx\
  sphinx-autobuild \
  sphinx-copybutton \
  xdoctest
```
