# Project standards

## General recomendations

* Projects must provide a way to build artifacts using standard tools (i.e. no
    custom scripts made for a specific machine/environment)
  * a package or binary depending on the language
  * a docker image
* Projects must include a Changelog following the
  [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0) recommendation
* Project must adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
  * Or [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) if it makes more sense.
* Projects must use Issues and Pull Request templates
* Projects must use meaningful labels
* Projects must be documented
* Projects must automate all their maintenance tasks
  * Must ensure reproducibility
  * A Makefile, justfile or a package.json at the root of the project is a good
    example of how to automate maintenance tasks.
  * The commands must be backed by scripts (instead of being written inline).
* Start designing API specification before implementation (i.e. design first
    approach)
  * OpenAPI 3+ specification
  * Zalando provides very good
    [RESTful API Guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/)
    worth following

## Continuous Integration

The CI rules:

* Projects must comply with CI task requirements.
* Developpers must be able to run the tasks locally.
* The CI acts as the source of truth.

### Required tasks

* Formatter
* Linters
  * Code
  * Docs
* Static analyzers
* Documentation
* Unit tests
* Feature tests
  * Try to cover 100% of use cases
    * This is more important than the unit test coverage
    * It will end up increasing unit test coverage anywway
* Integration tests
  * Can use network, database, file system, storage, etc.
  * **Are NOT included in the code coverage**
* Coverage
  * Reaching 100% coverage is not the end goal
  * Must never regress
  * Think about your teammates who worked on increasing this coverage
  * Use online services like [coveralls](https://coveralls.io) or [codecov](https://codecov.io)
